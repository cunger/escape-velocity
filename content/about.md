Hi, I'm Christina, a software engineer with 8 years of experience in building and maintaining large code bases, a background in formal logic, and a strong interest in nuclear technology and software system safety.

I enjoy working with complex legacy systems, and thrive in multidisciplinary settings and non-mainstream niches.

### Links

I have stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/cunger/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-unger).

### What's this?

These pages are notes for my future self, as I'm sure it will need to look up stuff regularly.

If you happen to look at them as well and have suggestions or questions, found errata, or just want to chat, please feel free to reach out.
