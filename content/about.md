☢️ I have a strong interest in **nuclear technology**.

🛠️ I love to be a **technical enabler**. For me, software is a tool that is most valuable when it supports experts to do their job well. I see it as my task to properly build, maintain, and improve this tool.

🚀 I thrive in **multidisciplinary settings**, and I'm often best when working at the interfaces between topics, fields, or teams.

🫠 In the grander scheme of things, I see my place at the foundation for building a better future: properly **tending to our legacy** - in particular nuclear waste, CO2 emissions, complex legacy code bases, and biosphere conservation.
