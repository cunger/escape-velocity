Software engineer with 8 years of experience in building and maintaining large code bases,
a foundation in formal logic and applied mathematics, and 
a strong interest in nuclear technology and software system dependability.

I enjoy working with complex legacy systems, and thrive in multidisciplinary settings and non-mainstream niches.
