I‚Äôm Christina, a professional software engineer with a strong interest in nuclear technology.

I love to be a **technical enabler**. For me, software is a tool that is most valuable when it supports experts to do their job well. I see it as my task to properly build, maintain, and improve this tool.

I thrive in **multidisciplinary settings**, and I'm often best when working at the interfaces between topics, fields, or teams.

In the grander scheme of things, I see my place at the foundation for building a better future: properly **tending to our legacy** - in particular nuclear waste, CO2 emissions, complex legacy code bases, and biosphere conservation.
