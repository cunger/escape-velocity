I'm a programmer, currently developing and maintaining code at <a href="https://www.mercury.ai">Mercury.ai</a>. I have a formal degree in logic and now spend my early mornings learning the fundamentals of nuclear technology and system safety. Besides those, I love scuba diving, and I'm sure I would also love flying to space.
