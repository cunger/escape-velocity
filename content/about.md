I'm a software engineer, currently developing and maintaining code at <a href="https://www.mercury.ai">Mercury.ai</a>. I love programming and scuba diving, and I'm sure I would also love flying to space. I have a formal degree in logic and now spend my early mornings learning the fundamentals of nuclear technology and the skills for helping to keep complex systems safe.
