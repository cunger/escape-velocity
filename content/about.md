These pages are notes for my future self, as I'm sure it will need to look up stuff regularly. I therefore keep several notebooks:

* [Mathematics](/docs/maths/)
* [Software Development](/docs/dev/)
* [Nuclear Engineering](/docs/nuctec/), including some of the necessary background in physics

# Education

* Mathematical-Technical Software Engineering (B.Sc., applied to start Oct 2020)
* [Patchwork studies](/patchwork)
* Computational Linguistics (PhD)
* Logic and Linguistics (M.A., passed with distinction)
* Mathematics (B.A. level)

# Volunteering

I deeply care about marine conservation, and volunteering in this field has been among the most inspiring, energizing, and humbling experiences I had.

* [Love the Oceans](https://lovetheoceans.org), Mozambique (2018)
* [Cetacean Research & Rescue Unit](http://www.crru.org.uk/), Scotland (2016)

# Contact

If you find errata, have suggestions for learning resources, or just want to share experiences, please feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to chat or meet for a coffee.

# Footprint

This page has a [carbon footprint of 0.08 g](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/cunger-github-io-about/), and the notebook pages are comparable with [those of the Low Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html).
