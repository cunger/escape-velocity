### Links

I have stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/cunger/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-unger).

### What's this?

These pages are notes for my future self, as I'm sure it will need to look up stuff regularly.

If you happen to look at them as well and have suggestions or questions, found errata, or just want to chat, please feel free to reach out.
