These pages are notes for my future self, as I'm sure it will need to look up stuff regularly.
All notes are (and will probably always be) work in progress.

# Education

# Volunteering

I deeply care about marine conservation, and volunteering in this field has been among the most inspiring, energizing, and humbling experiences I had. I spent short periods of time with [Love the Oceans](https://lovetheoceans.org) (Mozambique, 2018) and the [Cetacean Research & Rescue Unit](http://www.crru.org.uk/) (Scotland, 2016).

I also consider myself part of [Generation Atomic](https://www.generationatomic.org/).
