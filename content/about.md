I'm a software engineer, currently developing and maintaining code at [Mercury.ai](https://www.mercury.ai).
I spend my early mornings learning the fundamentals of nuclear technology and acquiring the skills for helping to build a [sustainable future](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/). These pages are notes for my future self, as I'm sure it will need to look up stuff regularly.
