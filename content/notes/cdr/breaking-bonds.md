# Understanding CO2

# Removing CO2 from the atmosphere

There are two main ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere:

* Chemical capture: Bind it to something else.
  * Bind it to liquid solvent or solid sorbent. Mineralization. Inorganic.
  * Carbonization of calciumhydroxide. Cyan.
  * Organic: photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O --light--> C6H2O6 + 6O2 (the water is oxidized, meaning it loses electrons, while the carbon dioxide is reduced, meaning it gains electrons). cyanobacteria?

* Break it apart (into C and O2).
  * Breaking the first bond (CO2 -> CO + O): https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100308095840.htm
  * Breaking both bonds.

bond energy is
the amount of energy that it takes to break a bond between
two atoms.

activation energy is the amount of energy that needs
to be absorbed for a chemical reaction to start.

An endothermic chemical reaction absorbs more energy than
it releases. The products have a higher bond energy than the
reactants, and the difference in bond energy is absorbed from
the surroundings. Photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction (absorbing sunlight).

An exothermic chemical reaction releases more energy than it
absorbs. The products have a lower bond energy than the
reactants, and the difference in bond energy is released to the
surroundings.
