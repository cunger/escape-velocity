# Photon interactions

When gamma rays (high energy photons) interact with matter, there are three primary ways their energies can be absorbed by materials:

* Photoelectric effect
* Compton scattering
* Pair production

# Charged particles

ions, electrons

* Radiative (Bremsstrahlung)
* Ionization (Inelastic scattering)
* Rutherford (elastic) scattering

# The four cookies

> Suppose you have four cookies: A gamma emitting cookie, a neutron emitting cookie, a beta emitting cookie, and an alpha emitting cookie. You have to eat one, put one in your pocket, hold one in your hand, and throw the other away. Which do you do with each, and why?

Alpha particles can be quite energetic but have a very short range. So they are not penetrating far, skin is actually enough to stop them. So you can hold it in your hand. But you definitely don't want an alpha emitter within your body (e.g. as result of smoking).

Beta particles are effectively blocked by one layer of clothing, so you can put it in your pocket.

Gamma radiation is high energy photons. You eat it and most of it will leave your body. In any case, you'll get the same amount of radiation from having it eaten or holding it in your hand or pocket.

And you throw the neutron cookie away. Neutrons have a large range, since they have neutral charge, so they can be stopped only by a lot of dense matter. They also tend to activate whatever they hit. You want to be as far away from neutron sources as possible.
