# Photon interactions

When gamma rays (high energy photons) interact with matter, there are three primary ways their energies can be absorbed by materials:

* Photoelectric effect
* Compton scattering
* Pair production

# Charged particles

ions, electrons

* Radiative (Bremsstrahlung)
* Ionization (Inelastic scattering)
* Rutherford (elastic) scattering
