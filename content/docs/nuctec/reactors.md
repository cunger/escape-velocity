{{< katex display="{}^{235}_{92}U + {}^1_0n \to \text{fission products} + 2.44 {}^1_0n + \gamma + \overline(v) + Q" >}}

Where:

* The fission products carry kinetic energy in the order of nano meters, i.e. they stay in the fuel.
* {{< katex "\overline(v)" >}} are antineutrinos.
* The reaction also releases (or consumes) energy {{< katex "Q" >}} (the Q-value of the reaction).
