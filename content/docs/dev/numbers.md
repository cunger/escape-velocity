# Byte ranges

Most computers don't access individual bits in memory, but use blocks of 8 bits (_bytes_) as smallest addressable unit of memory.

* In binary notation: from `00000000` to `11111111`
* In decimal notation: from `0` to `255` (there are `2^8 = 256` combinations of eight `0`s and `1`s)
* In hexadecimal notation: from `00` to `FF`
