_Mechanical waves_ are caused by a disturbance or vibration in matter (solid, gas, liquid, plasma). For example, sound waves are formed by vibrations in air or water. They travel through their medium by causing the molecules to bump into each other, transferring energy from one to the next. In vacuum, there is no medium to transmit mechanical waves. So sound waves, for example, cannot travel in space.

_Electromagnetic waves_ are a magnetic field {{< katex "B" >}} and an electric field {{< katex "E" >}} generating each other. This makes them travel without a medium.

Their speed is constant in vacuum (the speed of light), but they're slowed down when traveling through matter.

The more energy an EM wave has, the shorter its wavelength, and vice versa. See the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://eo-college.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/electromagnetic-spectrum-nasa.jpeg). High-energy EM waves, starting somewhere in the ultraviolet, are ionizing, i.e. they have enough energy that they can knock electrons out of atoms. Earth's atmosphere has an optical window and a radio window, and absorbs most of the other wavelengths. This shields us especially from ionizing radiation from the sun. On the other hand, the atmosphere is transparent to radio waves and thus makes radar remote sensing possible (which is largely independent of cloud coverage and rain fall, as the size of those droplets is much smaller than the wavelength).
