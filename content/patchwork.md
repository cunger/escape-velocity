The list of resources below is growing and evolving as I proceed on a slow but steady learning journey towards nuclear proficiency and technical software engineering. As Marie Curie said: _Now is the time to understand more._

# Bookshelf

* 📖 G. Hager, G. Wellein: Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers.
* 📚 I. Hutchinson: A Student's Guide to Numerical Methods.
* 📚 C. Baier, J.-P. Katoen: Principles of Model Checking.
* S. Yip: Nuclear Radiation Interactions.

(📖 means "currently reading" and 📚 means "on the stack".)
