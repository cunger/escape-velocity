The list of resources below is growing and evolving as I proceed on a slow but steady learning journey towards nuclear proficiency and technical software engineering. As Marie Curie said: _Now is the time to understand more._

# Bookshelf

* ðŸ“– S. Yip: Nuclear Radiation Interactions.
* ðŸ“– J. Blandy, J. Orendorff: Programming Rust.
* ðŸ“š I. Hutchinson: A Student's Guide to Numerical Methods.
* ðŸ“š L. Lamport: Specifying Systems.
* B. Cox, J. Foreshaw: The Quantum Universe.
* C. Seife: Sun in a Bottle: The Strange History of Fusion and the Science of Wishful Thinking.

(ðŸ“– means "currently reading" and ðŸ“š means "on the stack".)
