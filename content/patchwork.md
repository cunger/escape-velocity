Starting from a standard Nuclear Engineering curriculum (such as [MIT](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/nuclear-science-engineering-course-22/), [Rensselaer](http://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=20&poid=4641), [Texas A&M](https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/nuclear/bs/#programrequirementstext), [U-M](https://ners.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate/objectives/)), I aim to compile an ongoing learning journey towards nuclear proficiency. It's not a degree from a traditional university; it's a patchwork of courses and books, that have proven excellent for acquiring the fundamental knowledge and skills of the field. Most importantly, it's growing and evolving as I dive deeper into the topic.

# Notes

I keep two notebooks:

* [Nuclear Technology](/docs/nuctec/) contains all things nuclear, including background in mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
* [Software Development](/docs/dev/) contains all things computational, including programming languages and development basics.

These pages are notes for my future self, as I'm sure it will need to look up stuff regularly.
