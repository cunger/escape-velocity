I took the Nuclear Engineering curriculum of [MIT](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/nuclear-science-engineering-course-22/) and [Rensselaer](http://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=20&poid=4641) as a starting point to compile an ongoing learning journey towards nuclear proficiency. It's not a degree from a traditional university. It's a patchwork of courses from renowned universities and books, that have proven excellent for acquiring the fundamental knowledge and skills of the field. It's growing and evolving as I dive deeper into the topic.

# Notes

I keep two notebooks:

* [Nuclear Technology](/docs/nuctec/) contains all things nuclear, including background in mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
* [Software Development](/docs/dev/) contains all things computational, including programming languages and development basics.

These pages are notes for my future self, as I'm sure it will need to look up stuff regularly.

# Projects

* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/): solving mathematical and numerical computing problems ([Fortran code](https://github.com/cunger/simulacron/tree/master/euler))
