Starting from Nuclear Engineering curriculi (such as the ones from [MIT](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/nuclear-science-engineering-course-22/), [Rensselaer](http://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=20&poid=4641), [Texas A&M](https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/nuclear/bs/#programrequirementstext), and [U-M](https://ners.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate/objectives/)), I aim to compile an ongoing learning journey towards nuclear proficiency. It's not a degree from a traditional university, and it's not supposed to be one. Just a patchwork of courses and books that help me acquiring the fundamental knowledge and skills of the field. Most importantly, it's growing and evolving as I dive deeper into the topic.

# Notes

I keep two notebooks:

* [Nuclear Technology](/docs/nuctec/) contains all things nuclear, including background in mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
* [Software Development](/docs/dev/) contains all things computational, including programming languages and development basics.

These pages are notes for my future self, as I'm sure it will need to look up stuff later.
They're updated regularly.
