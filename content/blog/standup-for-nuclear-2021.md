It’s a scenic location, right in front of the Brandenburger Tor. Polar bears rollerskate and dance across the square. Someone is juggling, while songs about nuclear energy sound from the loudspeakers. Pro-nuclear advocates might not make a crowd, but they surely know how to have fun.

The demonstration is well timed. People who have been at COP26 in Glasgow don’t mind a stop in Berlin on their way home, including James Hansen himself. The resulting guest list is impressively international.

They came to speak up, condemning Germany for its energy policy. For phasing out nuclear before coal. For asking neighbors to do the same. For sabotaging nuclear‘s status as clean energy and instead promoting natural gas. They are urging us to reconsider.

The Germans who listen are mainly members of [Nuklearia](https://nuklearia.de/), a non-profit organization I joined last year. They are nuclear advocates, a rare bunch in this country, and they mainly stay among themselves on this sunny afternoon.

As a German I feel lonely, right in the heart of Berlin. I have the impression that the event fails at its most crucial task: engaging the general public in an open dialog, meeting them where they are, and uniting them along a common goal.
