When I first learned about climate change, there was plenty of uncertainty and time. It was one of many problems.

Now the game has changed. And we're not as informed about it as we should be.

* **Part 1** summarizes what I think we really need to understand - and what you might not yet be aware of. There are no elaborate examples and arguments, and no reference lists, rather it is a succinct invitation to reconsider what you know and think about climate change.

* **Part 2** then points to excellent resources that will get you up to speed if you don't want to take my word for it.

# Part 1: What we need to understand

## It's serious.

Climate change is happening. We have already warmed the planet over 1 degree C on average, and we're currently on track for 2 to 4 degrees C. What awaits us there is an uncertain - but certainly very uncomfortable - future.

We're moving towards changes that we will not be able to stop or revert, and that can eventually lead to a global ecosystem collapse and to parts of Earth being uninhabitable.

If this sounds bad, that's because it is.
Climate change is not a minor problem, it really is an existential crisis.

And it started already.

The closer we stay to 2 degrees C, the less catastrophic this will play out.

## It's personal.

Climate change does and will affect things you care about.

It's about you, your place, and your family.

For everyone of us.

## It's urgent.

The roadmap to staying somewhat safe says we need to halve our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050.

The scale of this task is staggering.

In fact, the numbers are so big and the timescale so tight, that no one single measure is enough. We need a wide range of scalable solutions.
And that cutting emissions alone will not do it. We also need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. (A lot of it.)

## It's not a technological problem.

It's easy to frame climate change as a problem that technology and money can fix.
But when we take a step back and look at the environmental problems of our time, the root runs much deeper.

We are consuming more than Earth can regenerate.
We are producing more than it can absorb.
And both at an increasingly damaging pace.

Our current economic markets and development models are failing us, because they are based on a world that doesn't exist anymore.

So this is not only a technological challenge, it's an economic, social, and cultural challenge as well.

If we want to stabilize Earth's ecosystem, we need to transform our place in it.

## It's not too late.

We are moving too slow. The world is already changing and it's too late to save all of it.
But that doesn't mean we're doomed.

There is a lot we can do to accelerate.
And there is a growing number of people ...

Breathe.
Think.
Act.
