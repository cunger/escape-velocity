"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." 

- James Clear


# Pragmatic Programmer: You're a professional now

# The unwritten laws of engineering
    
# Rapid devlopment

𝗥𝗮𝗽𝗶𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 is often not about running faster.

Instead, it’s about:

* Fundamentals. (Getting the software development process right already makes you fast enough in most cases.)

* Progress visibility. (Customers are often fine with the pace if they see continuous progress.)

# Reading Code

# Ownership

# PM mode vs worker bee mode

# Why technology choices are always partly emotional (nd why that' ok)
